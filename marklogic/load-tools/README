How to setup the WindyCityDB data for use in MarkLogic Server
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you're here at the conference, you can skip this and just set up a client to point
the shared server we're running.  But if you want to set up your own server, listen here:

1. We assume you've already installed MarkLogic Server on OS X and have a valid license.

2. Next, you'll want to create a forest, database, xdbc server, and http server in MarkLogic.

We have a couple tutorials that teach you how to do this using the admin UI at http://localhost:8001 starting at http://developer.marklogic.com/learn/2009-01-get-started-apps 

3. After that you'll want to unzip the data as

   % unzip marklogic-data.zip

4. You'll then want to drop a copy of XXX into an app server and run it to create the range indexes needed .

5. Then you can use the loading script to load the data in via the XDBC server as

    % load.sh [port]

The port is that TCP/IP port of the XDBC server you've setup.

---------

At the conference, we're actually setting up a single OS X server with multiple databases so each
client can have its own.  To automate the setup of these databases, you can 

1. Drop the xquery/setup.xqy script into /Library/MarkLogic/Admin/setup-windy.xqy and 
2. Browse to http://localhost:8001/setup-windy.xqy

This will create 6 databases (and the related forests and servers).  You can easily edit this script before running if you want more or less than 6.  No harm making extras today.

    The http servers will run at ports 9001, 9002, etc and will point to /tmp/marklogic as their root.
    The xdbc servers will run at ports 10001, 10002, 10003, etc.

You'll want to drop a copy of xquery/dynamic_dispatch.xqy into /tmp/marklogic/dynamic_dispatch.xqy for use with the ActiveDocument client.

    % mkdir /tmp/marklogic
    % cp xquery/dynamic_dispatch.xqy /tmp/marklogic

The setup-windy.xqy script also turn on some element range indexes that we know are needed by the specific
app we're using today.  (TODO: make the scripts do this!)

3. Next you'll want to load in the dataset.  We've have fast ways of doing this, but today we're just going
to use a simple and safe mechanism.  We've got a loading script that can be used to load
the marklogic-mogrified version of the XML dataset into each database as:

    % ./load.sh 10001
    % ./load.sh 10002
    % ./load.sh 10003
