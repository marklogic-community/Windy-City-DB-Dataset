How to setup the WindyCityDB data for use in MarkLogic Server
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you're here at the conference, you can skip this and just set up a client to point
the shared server we're running.  But if you want to set up your own server, listen here:

1. We assume you've already installed MarkLogic Server on OS X and have a valid license.

2. Next, you'll want to create a forest, database, xdbc server, and http server in MarkLogic.

We have a couple tutorials that start at http://developer.marklogic.com/learn/2009-01-get-started-apps
that will explain the basics of this if you want to set up your own copy of MarkLogic Server.

At the conference, we're actually setting up a single server with multiple databases so each
client can have its own.  To automate the setup of that, can drop the xquery/setup.xqy script into
OSX /Library/MarkLogic/Admin/setup-windy.xqy and browse to http://localhost:8001/setup-windy.xqy, which 
will create 6 databases (and the related forests and servers).  You can easily edit this script before running if you want
more or less than 6.  No harm making extras today.

The http servers will run at ports 9001, 9002, etc.
The xdbc servers will run at ports 10001, 10002, 10003, etc.

These scripts also turn on some element range indexes that we know are needed by the specific
app we're using today.  (TODO: make the scripts do this!)

3. Next you'll want to load in the dataset.  We've have fast ways of doing this, but today we're just going
to use a simple and safe mechanism.  We've got a loading script that can be used to load
the marklogic-mogrified version of the XML dataset into each database as:

./load.sh 10001
./load.sh 10002
./load.sh 10003
