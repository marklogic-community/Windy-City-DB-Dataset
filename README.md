#MarkLogic version of WindyCityDB Lab Data#

We've mogrified the XML version of the data from http://github.com/chicagoruby/Windy-City-DB-Dataset

In MarkLogic, you're best with lots of smaller XML documents.  If you're coming from a relational world, you may want to think of a Document as you would have a Row.  That's not a perfect analogy, but it will help sometimes.

We've left the original data in the data directory and added a marklogic-data.tar.gz which you can unpack to get at the MarkLogic version.
